                        Ever since the introduction of the original PlayStation, Nintendo 64, and the
                        Xbox, gaming started to integrate itself into the mainstream medium. You could now
                        comfortably sit at your home while playing these pre-made gaming boxes, with the
                        polygons that fill up the screen and the low framerate coupled by the 16-bit sounds ... <a

                        We all know the stereotype of the typical gamer who is portrayed as an anti-social fat dude that
                        lives in his mother’s basement. Either you are a little kid or a lonely male adult. Some may
                        argue that this case was true back then. However, with the increasing numbers of gamers of all
                        genders, races, and cultures nowadays. Gaming has become more of an accepted hobby and even a
                        career. What led to that?

                        Technology’s continued progress is nothing short of a miracle. The pace at which technology
                        becomes obsolete is now so fast that it has set a precedent of which we have never seen before.
                        There are many extraneous reasons for this, however the two largest industries that have pushed
                        technology forward unlike any other is pornography and the military...<a href="./articles/L.Dib-1/Dib1.html">Continue Reading</a>
