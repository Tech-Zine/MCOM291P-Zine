                We all know the stereotype of the typical gamer who is portrayed as an anti-social fat dude that lives
                in his mother’s basement. Either you are a little kid or a lonely male adult. Some may argue that this
                case was true back then. However, with the increasing numbers of gamers of all genders, races, and
                cultures nowadays. Gaming has become more of an accepted hobby and even a career. What led to that?
                Well, many things did, but the most important one, in the social aspect at least, is the implementation
                of chat in online multiplayer games. Back when in-game chat was not as widespread as today, gamers used
                to discuss their favorite games on forums such as GameFAQs, which was launched in 1995 and is still
                relevant to this day almost three decades later. However, with the rise of the Internet came the rise of
                multiplayer online games. Game developers first implemented chat boxes into games so players can only
                type what they want to say as they play or as they wait for a game in a lobby. Later on, with the
                release of the gaming console Dreamcast, in 2000, SegaNet released a web browser that integrated voice
                chat into their games. “Internet services such as YahooChat! worked on the Java-compatible web browsers
                with the ability of voice chat with the microphone” (“Voice chat in online gaming”). With voice chat in
                their games, players can now communicate, either as friends having casual conversations during their
                game or to make tactical decisions when playing competitively. Since “the way videogames are both
                thought of and used, critically and popularly, physically and rhetorically, is gendered.” (Thornham,
                127) Voice chat begins to have negative effects, such as serious numbers of harassment towards women.

                Recently, a famous Twitch streamer called Macaiyla was playing Valorant live, her team lost, and thus
                “one of Macaiyla’s teammates wasn’t happy with the result and went on a sexist tirade against the
                content creator.” (Young) However, the way communication in-game has led players to develop their social
                abilities and even get out of their comfort zone. For instance, introverted people can now communicate
                with random people that love the same specific thing they love, all in the comfort of their room, it is
                a beautiful thing. Voice chatting alone has been the beginning of many friendships and relationships.
                When game designers noticed the importance of communication in multiplayer games, they opted to figure
                out new ways to make it more immersive. In 2020, during the lockdowns worldwide due to coronavirus
                specifically, one game filled the time of every gamer who was looking for ways to experience social
                interactions while physically staying at home. That game is VRChat, a free-to-play VR game, released in
                early access in 2017. Thomas H. Apperley and Justin Clemens discuss avatars “In accordance with the
                well-known tendency whereby digital media begin to affect already existing conceptions of human social
                interaction”, she adds “and includes both avatars that are fully customizable down to the minutest
                detail.” (45)

                The game was a revolutionary massively-multilayer-online VR game, the first of its kind. It allowed each
                player to customize his avatar to unbelievable degrees, such as implementing direct custom models into
                the game, you could look through the eyes of a tiny SpongeBob, or a huge green Hulk. These are just two
                of other limitless possibilities. Players could even use trackers on their bodies to simulate their
                movement in-game. When people realized you could also play it without a VR headset. The player count
                rose during the pandemic to the point that “on April 13th, VRChat hit its highest usership since its big
                viral spike back in 2018, reaching just over 16,000 concurrent Steam users.” (Lang) People went out to
                golf parks, bars, drank their beers, and had virtual birthdays. All in one single game. Hopefully, in
                the coming years, sexually deprived men can stop their misogyny so females will feel as comfortable as
                men do when hopping on to the voice chat channels, meanwhile, we should appreciate the way games have
                the ability to bring us all together.
