                With the expansion of new sets of technologies, gaming consoles and devices are evolving as well. This
                image illustrated shows the development of devices through years and decades. As we know, the first
                gaming console created was Atari. Its concepts and features have evolved in time in order to create new
                consoles such as Nintendo, Xbox, Play Station and PC.

                Moreover, the episode Striking Vipers in Black Mirror reflects the impact of the future science on
                gaming. During the movie, the main characters plugged a ship into their heads in order to be stimulated
                in the video game. This form of technology projects the similarities of the emotions and feelings felt
                and the actions done by the characters in both real and virtual worlds.

            </div>
            <br>
            <p>
                Furthermore, the expansion of technology did not only influence the gaming devices, as much as it has
                impacted the content of the games, consisting of the development and enlargement of the stories, the
                avatars, the characters, as well as the spatial features.

                Since the improvement of technology has influenced the gaming industry, the graphics, the displays, the
                gestures, the voices and facial recognitions have also changed and evolved.

            <br>
            <p>
                For example, Mario Kart has expanded its features and design in order to adapt to the innovation of high
                technology.
