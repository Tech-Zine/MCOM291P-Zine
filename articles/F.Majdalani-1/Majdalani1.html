                From the wide success of arcade games came a new technology, one that allowed video game fanatics to
                play their favorite games straight from home. Home video game consoles are consoles that have to be
                connected to a display device, such as a television, and an external power. Despite them being less
                powerful than PCs, they were specifically designed to maintain higher graphics and lower memory to
                provide affordable prices. These consoles have proven to be relatively successful during their time of
                exposure despite their ups and downs. In this article, I will be enlightening you about the wondrous
                evolution of the most successful home gaming consoles from the oldest to the most recent.

                        This gaming console is acclaimed for promoting the use of “microprocessor-based hardware and
                        games
                        stored on ROM cartridges”. The Atari 2600 was famous for bringing arcade games, such as Pong and
                        Pac-Man, to home consoles. It was especially successful in the conversion of the arcade hit
                        game,
                        Space Invaders, into the first ever cartridge bundle that “quadrupled sales of their home
                        consoles”
                        (High Score, Episode 1).

                        This console is the successor of the first Odyssey console by Magnavox. That first console
                        pioneered with the first home console brought to market.

                        The name of this console is a portmanteau2 of “intelligent television”. This gaming console had
                        superior graphics and sound to its competitor the Atari 2600, and it was even advertised as
                        being "the closest thing to the real thing".

                        This console offered a more powerful arcade experience that the Atari gaming consoles, along
                        with the ability to upgrade the system’s hardware. Approximately 145 titles, including
                        Nintendo’s Donkey Kong and Sega’s Zaxxon, were published as ROM cartridges, along with releasing
                        hardware add-ons and special controllers to expand the console’s capabilities.

                        This console is a higher-end successor to the Atari 2600; however, it fell far short to its 30
                        million sales success. It was created to compete with the Intellivion but ended up competing
                        with the ColecoVision.

                        conversion of the arcade game Donkey Kong. This console provided a gameplay that is more similar
                        to that of the arcade that what the other systems provided (High Score, Episode 2). The NES
                        featured groundbreaking success with games such as Super Mario Bros. and The Legend of Zelda. It
                        is also one of the best-selling consoles of all time.

                        This console was released as a competitor to the Nintendo Entertainment System. It featured
                        newer and more improved hardware than the NES. However, it was unable to reach the latter’s
                        success in Japan and the US, but rather reached more success in Europe and Brazil.

                        It is also known as PC engine outside America. It was designed by Hudson Soft and manufactured
                        and marketed by NEC. This console failed to break into the US market; however, due to it being
                        released earlier in Japan, it was more successful there. It got criticism over its marketing as
                        a 16-bit console and having the number “16” in its name when it used an 8-bit CPU like its
                        predecessors.

                        This console has a 16-bit CPU, and is the successor to the Master System. It became famous for
                        its game series Sonic the Hedgehog, which was the most iconic game Sega ever made (High Score,
                        Episode 4). It gave rise to a new era of competitive gaming (High Score, Episode 4). However,
                        this console also triggered some controversies. One of the controversies was the console war
                        with Nintendo that brought about great attention from the public. The other was the violent
                        games controversy, for games such as Night Trap and Mortal Kombat, that led to the creation of
                        the Videogame Rating Council.

                        Sega Genesis, with the latter having a two year lead to the SNES, lower prices, a larger
                        library, and a higher age group target, this console became the best-selling console of the
