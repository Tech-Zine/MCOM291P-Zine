                Ever since technology has merged with gaming, the world continues to see the rapid evolution and
                improvement of video games decade after decade. We have come so far from any expectations with how the
                new technology is shaping the video games that we play and experience every day. One of the biggest
                game-changer elements that benefitted from new technologies is the game engines. In this essay, I talk
                about how game engines drastically improved gaming to the way we see it today.

                A game engine is a software development program that allows game developers to build and design video
                games for console, mobile, or PCs. Back in the 90s, first-person shooter games, like Doom, were
                dominating the gaming scene and arousing the attention of most all players. Doom is a first-person
                shooter game that contains a lot of gore and violence in it -- it is a 2D game where players can only
                turn left and right and stumble against 2-3 enemies on their screen to fight them. At that time, a team
                of 6 Croatian people was thoroughly interested in playing and developing video games, so they planned on
                developing a new game engine that would meet their development capabilities. They wanted the players to
                see up to 100 enemies/NPCs (Non-playable characters) on the screen without causing the PC to crash due
                to all the animations going on; that has never been done before by any huge game companies at that time.

                So, this team built the Serious Engine game engine that ran the Serious Sam video game, which is
                based-off Doom, Duke Nukem, Quake, and a lot of first-person shooter games. The game could run on old
                and weak PCs, which is quite interesting considering the number of NPCs that the game would render in
                front of you. It was the kick-starter for how game developers could benefit from and improve the game
                engines -- this allowed big games to fully-render numerous animations playing at once while not burning
                and overheating the device you are playing on. Today, Serious Sam continues to be one of the biggest
                games that utilize the inclusion of countless numbers of enemies rendering all at once, thanks to the
                new Serious Engine 4 game engine. The game is reportedly said to show over 100,000 enemies on one screen
                which is a crazy number to think of.

                Moreover, fast-forward to today’s generation, technology is continuously and massively contributing to
                help shape video games in a fantastic way that has never been seen before. The image above is taken from
                a video Demo, released by Unreal Engine, showcasing the next-gen real-time graphics that the gaming
                world will see in the upcoming years. Unreal Engine is a game engine developed by Epic Games, and it is
                one of the most popular and leading engines in the gaming industry nowadays. This video focuses on three
                main systems that explain, in detail, how games like this one utilized improvised technology. The first
                system is called Lumen, which is responsible for the dynamic global lightning. Usually, in video games,
                game designers use custom textures on their games to lighten or darken the surfaces the way they like,
                however, this technology depends only on one source which is the sun rays and lightning coming from the
                sun in the game. This other new system helps global lightning to bounce off the surfaces naturally when
                the sun rays hit them, it is called the Nanite. Rather than rebuilding and re-texturing every object
                found in the game, developers can now capture real-life textures of dirt, rocks, sand… and place them
                in-game, and allow the new game engine to restructure them using tiny triangles. Every object we see
                in-game and on our screens is made of tiny and numerous squares or triangles that would help shape them
                into the way we see them. These reportedly billions of tiny triangles found in the game interact
                naturally with the sunbeam coming directly towards them and bounce them off to other surfaces. These
                tiny bits that you see in the image below are the tiny triangles that shape the textures of the game --
                they almost look like pixels. This image is also taken from the game that was showcased in the Unreal
                Engine 5 video.

            </div>
            <br>
            <p>
                Additionally, the Niagara system allows for dynamic and smooth interactions between the character you
                are playing with and the environment around him, as well as between the NPCs and nature. Let’s say your
                character is going through a narrow opening of a huge rock, and some dirt fell on him -- the character
                would interact and clean the dirt off him. All these new systems and technologies help build
                photorealistic video games, and photorealism is an art that is indistinguishable from reality.

                Speaking of new advancements in technologies, loading screens have always been so annoying to sit and
                stare at, not to mention the same tips and tricks that always rotate while the game is loading. With the
                introduction of the new PlayStation 5 console from Sony, games load up so quickly in a way that has
                never been seen before, thanks to the new insanely fast custom SSD (Solid State Drive) that was built by
                Sony. Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales was one of the very few games that were made to be fully
                optimized on the PS5 on day one. From the time you press ‘Launch Game’ to the time you get to the main
                menu screen, there are only 10 seconds of waiting. Ten seconds to load a full game that has the latest
                technological systems and top-notch graphics is crazy to think of.

                In brief, it is amazingly cool to see how seamless, dynamic, and realistic video games are becoming in
                the past few years. It is as if we are leaping at a fast pace in technology and utilizing its true
                hidden capabilities by merging it with the beautiful world of games. Game developers never fail to amaze
                their audiences with the consistent improvement of the game engines, which open new horizons for players
                to explore and experience the games they play on a whole new realistic-like level. I cannot wait to see
                what the future of gaming holds for us!
