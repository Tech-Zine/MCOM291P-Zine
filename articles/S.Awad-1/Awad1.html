                Shifting through Worlds: How Technology has Redefined the Relationship between Gamer and Game?
            </h1>
            <br>

            <br>

                The greatest exceptionality of video games lies in its shape shifting as a medium both as a reaction to
                the evolution of technologies as well as a motive driving their advancements. The gaming medium
                distinguishes itself from other forms of narrative and media through what Gonzilla Frasca describes as
                the video games element of “stimulation,” or choice (Frasca, 2014). The most “wow” factor that commits
                gamers to their journey and investment in the game is that the gamer has agency and power within the
                game. A gamer’s agency is possible only because of the technology the realm of video games enjoy and
                with the technological evolution of these virtual worlds gamers are becoming more and more attached. As
                these technologies develop into what Nell Bushnell, founder of Atari, would have considered science
                fiction only decades ago, the gamer’s’ relationship between the virtual world and real world is becoming
                perhaps dangerously blurred.

            <h3>Blast from the past: </h3>
            <br />
            <p>
                In order to understand the blurring line phenomenon, it is essential to understand the trajectory of
                video games evolution from its roots in the 1970s. But, why? Tracing the evolution of video games and
                their technology is the best method to trace the relationship between gamers and video games or the
                virtual world and how this relationship has progressed.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The history of gaming can be traced back to 3500 B.C or to an amusement park with Bushell. Both are
                accurate answers; both give a glimpse into the evolution of play and its technology. Speaking in
                technicalities, the strict development of video games and their consoles can be divided into eight
                generations beginning in the first generation of 1967-1975 encompasses Magnavox Odyssey and Pong system
                and ending in the most recent 2020 generation of CyberPunk 2077. When comparing the Pong, the first
                commercially successful video game, in the arcade setting with the gaming industry’s massive releases
                today, it becomes apparent video game development has transformed and with it has the relationship
                between gamer and game.

                Over the development of play and then the more specific subsection of play “video games”, it can be
                irrefutably discerned that gamers or players have gained more and more momentum and agency within the
                game. It can even be said that while board games and chess once dictated the player, now the player or
                gamer dictates the game and its output like in games like Unit Dawn, a 2015 interactive drama horror
                video game. Gonzalo Frasca illustrates this in more depth in “Videogames of the Oppressed” as he
                explains that videogames “unlike narrative, which is constituted by a fixed series of actions and
                descriptions, video games need the active content” (Frasca, 2014). In turn, a video game’s advancement
                in the course of technological evolutions can be measured by how well of a job the developers and game
                design team does at making the games interactive. The latest games are those that offer space in a game
                allowing the gamer to move and control the virtual world. The ultimate goal of game and tech is to
                create a stimulation that appears effortless and allows the gamer to take hold of his/her avatar, their
                actions, choices and so on. In an interview earlier this April with a gamer and current employee of the
                industry in Lebanon, Mira Chami, she exclaimed, “the best games are the ones that make you feel like you
                are in the game.”

            <h3>The Avatar:Technology Fusing the Real & the Virtual: </h3>
            <br />
            <p>The billion dollar gaming industry is gaining more and more hype with these developments. Yet, there
                remains an aspect of this development that mediates the gamer and the game validating the virtual world
                not as a mere entertainment dimension of the real world but as a universe parallel to it.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                Gamer interactivity technologies have allowed developers to more or less transcend space through
                avatars. Many games today focus on the “avatar as the mediating device between real and virtual spaces”
                (Apperley and Clemens, 2017). The avatar technologies allow the gamer to connect with the game at a
                deeper level as his/her spaces of virtual realities vs real world realities becomes blurred on both the
                levels of space and identity. In games such as Pokemon GO, which writer JV Chamary describes as one of
                the “most successful mobile games of all time,” the AR technology that allows for the avatar’s immersion
                in real life spaces breaks the boundary that was traditionally held between the gamer’s real life and
                his/her virtual life. This goes to feed into how technology has redefined the gamer’s relationship with
                the spaces of the game.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                As for the other aspect of identity, the technologies of avatars have allowed for the gamer to be more
                fully present in the game. It is almost as if the only thing missing is for the gamer to feel the
                physical emotions of his/her avatar. A new technology introduced earlier this year allows for facial
                recognition and 3D scanning systems to recreate a gamer’s likeness in the virtual world. This form of
                technology helps integrate so many forms of identity into the virtual world that was once monopolized by
                the avatar of the white heterosexual protagonist. Simultaneously, the Intel RealSense are working on
                allowing game developers to make video games that can read a gamer’s emotions by scanning over 70
                different points on an individual’s face. Not to sound too cheesy, but this is just the tip of the
                iceberg of gaming technologies.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                The avatar technologies are revolutionizing what it means to game; the gamer now has an identity that
                can penetrate through spaces of virtual and real world. Gamers today have agency and abilities to
                represent themselves and their identities to connect to different spaces and even to emotionally
                communicate with a game in real time. In this sense, “reality is broken. Game designers can fix it”
                (McGonigal, 2010). The relationship between gamer and game has come a long way from Pac Man and so has
                the reality in the real world. The advancements are beautiful but also frightening because if the
                gamer’s relationship with the game has changed, then what does that mean for his/her relationship with
                the real world.
