            <h2>Our Vision</h2>
            <br>
            Since gaming and technology are closely tied together, any advancements made in the field of
            technology has directly affected gaming in hugely positive ways. The emergence of better game
            engines and graphic processors has provided players a better all-round experience. This
            resulted in a symbiotic relationship between the two -- where the crave for new games is
            pushing technology to new heights, and vice versa. With all the rapid consumption of media
            nowadays, it is nice to take a step back and appreciate the technological milestones that set a
            course to new horizons in gaming.

            “Sometimes it's not always about what you can see or hear but what's under the hood of a game
            that's most impressive. Between those thousands and thousands of lines of code, magic happens.
            Sometimes the most amazing feats of gaming wizardry happen without you even noticing.”
