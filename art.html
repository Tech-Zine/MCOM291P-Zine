                <h1> A World In My World</h1>
                <br>
                <p class="poem" style="text-align: center;">
                    Back in the day when i was a young child<br /><br />
                    The Nintendo 64 instantly had me wired<br /><br />
                    A plastic device with a game in the shape of a block<br /><br />
                    Super Mario 64 had me jumping on shells and eating mushrooms a lot <br /><br />
                    The simplicity was key, never did I think I’d need more <br /><br />
                    Until game developers decided to create a new door <br /><br />
                    Fast forward to 2021<br /><br />
                    The way video-gaming has now become<br /><br />
                    can be looked at as a lifestyle rather than just for fun<br /><br />
                    A new world to dive into<br /><br />
                    A different way to interact with people<br /><br />
                    Now considered an E-Sport<br /><br />
                    A way to make money that is in fact legal<br /><br />
                    It blows my mind to see careers be made out of a fake reality <br /><br />
                    But the passion for a universe that is stuck in your screen could be our originality <br /><br />
                    From so basic to now so in depth<br /><br />
                    Even Pokemon has become more than just a bunch of texts<br /><br />
                    Open-world games with cities to explore<br /><br />
                    and High skill games for players to compete<br /><br />
                    Story-lines waiting for you to absorb <br /><br />
                    and tournaments to win a treat <br /><br />
                    The addiction is real <br /><br />
                    The grind has changed<br /><br />
                    Instead of playing on my own <br /><br />
                    I have my friends online to engage <br /><br />
                    It has become a reality in my reality, a world in my world<br /><br />
                    and to my surprise, there is still more to unfold.<br /><br />
