                    <p>Videogames have been present for many years where computer scientists started designing simple
                        games and simulations on mainframe computers with one dimensional graphics and designs. One of
                        the very first videogame was “Spacewar!” which simply included a needle and a wedge where the
                        player would simply engage in a dodge fight. Old games such as Tetris or Blix contained easy and
                        plain graphics and not many rules. As time passes, technology developpes into something more
                        sophisticated, and has affected the way we play videogames. Play is a free activity with bounded
                        rules while entering the realm of make- believe, which contains Mimicry, Agon, Alea and Ilinx
                        (Cailliois, 2001). The intensification of Play comes from the development of technology as it
                        highly affects the emergence of better game engines and graphics processors which play a big
                        role on the engagement of the player, as well as the evolution of narrative based games into
                        what they are today.</p>

                        Ever since technology has merged with gaming, the world continues to see the rapid evolution and
                        improvement of video games decade after decade. We have come so far from any expectations with
                        how the new technology is shaping the video games that we play and experience every day. One of
                        the biggest game-changer elements that benefitted from new technologies is the game engines. In
                        this essay, I talk about how game engines drastically improved gaming to the way we see it
                        today.
